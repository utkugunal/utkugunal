# Welcome dear visitor!

Hi! It is Utku here. After a professional experience in Automotive Engineering and Consulting, I decided to take the chance to dive into the exciting world of coding!
My Web Development journey has just started here at Spiced!

And I am glad to say that I am a part of the cohort "Lime".
